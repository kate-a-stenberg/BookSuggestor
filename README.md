# BookSuggestor

This is a program to suggest a book.

How it works is that the user inputs a book by entering all data. The program then returns a list of books based on their similarities to the book given by the user.

The program uses criteria and similarity scores to compare the traits if the given book to books in a list and returns the books with the highest similarity scores.

Currently the program supports Fantasy, Mystery, and Romance genres.

Future functionalities I would like to add:
1. when the user enters a book, it will be added to the CSV file.
2. instead of a CSV file, use a Database.
3. add other genres
4. give the user the ability to select which criteria are more important and less important (e.g., setting is more important and should be weighted more when calculating similarity scores)
5. Implement a  visual interface

Thanks for viewing!
