Ideas for expansion:
1. ask user how important each attribute is for similarity - assign weights based on user input
2. read input book and append to file
3. add GUI
4. change stuff to follow SOLID principles
5. include other factors: disability presence, mood for all books, romance presence in all books, concepts, character types, subplots, publication date
6. include content warnings
7. allow users to specify things they absolutely do not want
8. allow for multiple genres at once (e.g. fantasy romance)
